# Developers Salary Prediction App using StreamLit
I've designed this Developers Salary Prediction Application based on a "Stackoverflow Developers Survey 2021" with the help of the Decision Trees, Random Forest, Scikit-Learn, StreamLit. It uses different features like Years of Experience, Gender, Country, 
Education Level to predict the developers salary in real-time. You can Predict the Salary and Explore the Salary by Country, Experience, and Gender.
